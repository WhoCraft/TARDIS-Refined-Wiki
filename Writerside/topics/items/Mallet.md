The Mallet is a versatile tool used for interacting with various controls and elements within the TARDIS. Its primary purpose is to assist in re-aligning misconfigured controls and performing renovations.

## Features

### Control Realignment
When used on TARDIS controls:
- The Mallet will re-align EVERY control back to its original healthy state.
- This process consumes durability from the Mallet.
- While re-aligning, the Mallet emits particles and sound effects for feedback.

### Cooldown Mechanic
- The Mallet has a cooldown period of 30 seconds (600 ticks) after each use to prevent spamming.
- Durability is consumed with each use, and the Mallet will break if its durability is fully depleted.
