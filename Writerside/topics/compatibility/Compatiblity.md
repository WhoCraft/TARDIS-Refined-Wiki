# Compatibility

While writing mods, it can be tough to predict what a different project not written by you is going to do! 
This can cause crashes, unexpected behavior and stop game progression, which is something we wish to avoid

If you have run into an issue with a mod while using Tardis Refined, report it to us [here](https://github.com/WhoCraft/TardisRefined/issues) and we will investigate it, attempt to sort it and try and point you in the right direction
