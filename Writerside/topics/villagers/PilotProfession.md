# Pilot Profession 

 This profession allows villagers to interact with the TARDIS, serving as pilots to control its flight.

## How It Works

### Interacting with a Pilot Villager

- **Payment in Emeralds**: To encourage the villager to pilot the TARDIS, players must pay them in **Emeralds**. Each Emerald adds time to the piloting task, allowing the villager to continue flying the TARDIS.
- **Piloting Time**: The villager keeps track of how long they’ve been piloting the TARDIS. If a villager has enough time, they will remain engaged in piloting tasks. If not, they will become upset and demand payment.

### The Villager's Role

- **Piloting**: When the villager is piloting, they are actively controlling the TARDIS’s flight. 
- **Handling Crashes**: If the TARDIS is in danger of crashing, the villager will panic, reacting accordingly to the situation.

### TARDIS Interaction

- **Flight Status**: The state of the TARDIS affects the villager's actions. If the TARDIS is in flight, the villager will perform work-related activities. If it's landing, they will celebrate. If it’s crashing, they will panic.

## Tips for Players

- **Pay the Pilot**: If you want the villager to continue piloting, make sure to keep them well-compensated with Emeralds. Failing to do so may lead to them stopping their work or becoming unhappy.
- **Watch for Feedback**: The villager will communicate their remaining time left with you via right-clicking the villager.
