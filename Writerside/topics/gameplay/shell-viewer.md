# Shell Viewer 

Following update 2.1.0, you can now view your TARDIS exterior from the Monitor screen!
This means that you can check for dangerous lava, the risk of falling off cliffs and just whether you like the location you've landed

## How do I use it?
To access the Shell Viewer, navigate your active TARDIS console and interact with your computer bank; upon opening the screen, you will see your exterior shell spinning in the vortex

## What information can I see?

From this screen, you will be able to see the current coordinates of the TARDIS, alongside your current throttle and current fuel

## Can I watch the TARDIS Fly?
Sortof! You can view the TARDIS flying through the vortex of your choice. However, currently there is no way to control the TARDIS from this screen and it is purely visual
Although, keep your eyes peeled ðŸ‘€ as we may introduce it another alternative to flying - if you intend to use this mode for a full flight I advise playing with other players, paying off a [villager pilot](PilotProfession.md) or using it to watch your TARDIS arrive at a [Landing Pad](The-Landing-Pad.md)

### Can I move the TARDIS around in the Vortex?
You can offset the rendering of the TARDIS via the usage of WASD
