# Adventure Mode

While we released the first iterations of this mod, way back in 1.19.2,
we found that mod-pack creators didn't like that the TARDIS could go to any dimension straight out the box.

We had settings to allow for blacklisting a dimension to avoid travel, but creators were more after a progression system of sorts

So we have now implemented our take on this!

## Is it on by default?
No! As we think it's a major change to players, it is disabled by default so that mod pack creators can enable and disable it at their own will

## How does it work? 
1. Players must [craft](Crafting-Table-Recipes.md#test-tube-only-required-in-adventure-mode-upcoming) a test tube!
2. Players must then travel to the dimension they want to add to their TARDIS
3. Players must then right-click the ground of the dimension
4. Players must wait around 5 minutes within the dimension with the sample within their inventory, so the sample has time to "decode"
5. Once this time has completed, the player must then go back into their TARDIS and right-click their monitor with their sample

## Notes:
- Exiting a dimension while a sample is decoding will wipe the sample from the test tube
- Test tubes will display progress via the tooltip 
- No, you cannot sample your fellow players TARDIS dimension
- Yes, adventure mode obeys the blacklist config aswell
- Yes, you can configure already unlocked dimensions via the config
