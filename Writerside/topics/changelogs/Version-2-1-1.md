# Apologies
In the previous version, we released a lot and it didn't quite meet the testing required for a release. Resulting in a terrible launch :(
You can find everything from 2.1.0 here: https://wiki.tardisrefined.net/version-2-1-0.html

#### Bug Fixes
- Bug Fix: Fixed Fuel Alarm going off when the TARDIS isn't fully grown yet
- Bug Fix: Fixed Vortex Overlay not being called on Forge
- Bug Fix: Fixed Vortex & Shell scales on Forge
- Bug Fix: Fixed keys not working as intended
- Bug Fix: Fixed Manipulator crafting not working as intended

### Enhancements
- Updated Factory Console Texture

### Additions
- Added: Skulker Shell (Just for fun <3)

### NOTE
- Old waypoints from pre-2.1.0 may cause issues and default to 0,0,0 - you may need to remake them :( (Trust me it's in the name of progress))
